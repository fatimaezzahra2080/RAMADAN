# Ramadan 365 🌙

Ramadan 365 is a lightweight, minimal, and non-judgmental Islamic habit-building app. It helps Muslims maintain their spiritual connection through small, achievable daily acts of worship.

- 🏗️ **[Architecture](design/architecture.md)**: Technical stack, layered architecture, and offline-first strategy.
- 🎨 **[UX & Screen Flow](design/ux_logic.md)**: Design philosophy, screen flows, and "No-Pressure" streak logic.
- ⭐ **[Feature Breakdown](design/feature_breakdown.md)**: Detailed look at core features like Daily Worship and Fasting Reminders.

## 🎯 Key Goals

1. **Calm & Minimal**: No clutter, no noise. Just one action a day.
2. **Consistency over Perfection**: A "Faith Glow" that rewards showing up, but doesn't punish missing a day.
3. **Privacy-First**: No personal data storage, no cloud requirements.
4. **Lightweight**: Optimized for all devices, working perfectly offline.
